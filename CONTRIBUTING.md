## RudderStack contributor's agreement ##

To contribute to this project, we need you to sign to [Contributor License Agreement (“CLA”)][CLA] for the first commit you make. By agreeing to the [CLA][CLA], we can add you to list of approved contributors and review the changes proposed by you.

## Submitting a pull request ##

Do you have an improvement?

1. Submit an [issue][issue] describing your proposed change.
2. We will try to respond to your issue promptly.
3. Fork this repo, develop, and test your code changes. See the project's [README](README.md) for further information about this repository.
4. Submit a pull request against this repo's `main` branch. Make sure you include the necessary instructions on testing your changes.

## Committing ##

We prefer squash or rebase commits so that all changes from a branch are committed to the main branch as a single commit. All the pull requests are squashed when merged, but rebasing prior to merge gives you better control over the commit message.
